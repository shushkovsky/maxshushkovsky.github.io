I did my undergraduate degree in computational biology at Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science with a minor in Russian Studies. Following that, I'll be part of CMU's first-ever integrated comp bio master's degree cohort. Also, I played collegiate soccer for CMU as a midfielder.

In the past, I interned at Amazon Web Services in Seattle, played semi-pro soccer in the NPSL, and interned at PostEra. 

After graduation, I'll be working full-time as a software engineer at PostEra.

Outside of work and school, I love to play volleyball, small-sided soccer, and footvolley.
